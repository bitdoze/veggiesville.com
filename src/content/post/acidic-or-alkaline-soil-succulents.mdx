There is some debate over whether succulents prefer acidic or alkaline soil. Most growers seem to think that succulents do better in slightly acidic soil, but there are exceptions. Some succulents, like sedums and sempervivums, actually prefer alkaline soil. If your soil is too acidic or too alkaline for your succulents, you can amend the soil by adding organic matter or limestone, respectively.

But if you're growing succulents specifically for the beauty of their foliage, it's best to make sure your soil is at least slightly acidic. In fact, most of them grow well inÂ soil with around pH6.

## Can Succulents Survive in any Soil?

Succulents are plants that have evolved to store water in their leaves, stems, or roots. This makes them very drought tolerant and able to survive in many types of soil. However, not all succulents will thrive in every type of soil. Sandy soils, for example, can be difficult for succulents to grow in because they do not hold water well. If you're planting succulents in sandy soil, try to amend it with compost or garden lime. Clay soils can also be challenging for succulents because they don't hold enough water for them to survive.

## Ingredients For a Succulent Soil

When caring for succulents, it is important to use a potting mix that drains well. A succulent soil mix can be made with ingredients that are readily available at most garden centers. The mix should consist of one part potting soil, one part sand, and one part perlite or vermiculite. If desired, a small amount of compost can be added to the mix to help improve drainage and provide nutrients to the plants.

## What are the signs of a pH imbalance in succulents?

If you are new to succulents, or just looking to be more knowledgeable about their care, it's important to learn about pH levels and how they can impact your plants. Most succulents prefer a soil pH of 6.0-7.5, but there are a few that can tolerate a pH as low as 5.0 or as high as 8.0. Soil pH is measured on a scale of 1-14, with 7 being neutral. A reading below 7 means the soil is acidic, while a reading above 7 means the soil is alkaline.

Soil pH can be easily tested using a soil test kit from your local garden center or home improvement store. The test kit will come with instructions on how to take a soil sample and how to read the results.

## How to Make Soil Acidic for Succulents

If you're not sure which of these additives will work best for your plants, start with a small amount and then increase the dosage if needed. Be careful not to add too much, as this can damage your plants. Also, you should test your soil for pH before adding any chemicals. You can also use a fertilizer that contains an acid-forming element.

There are a few ways to lower (acidify) or raise (alkalinize) the pH of soil. One common way to lower the pH of soil is to add sulfur. Sulfur reacts with water in the soil to form sulfuric acid, which lowers the pH. Another way to lower the pH is to add aluminum sulfate. Aluminum sulfate also reacts with water in the soil to form a weak acid that lowers the pH. To raise (alkalinize) the soil, lime can be added. Lime contains calcium carbonate, which reacts with water in the soil to form calcium hydroxide, a base that raises the pH.

## Are Coffee Grounds Good for Succulents?

Many gardeners have succulents and are always looking for ways to help them thrive. One question that comes up often is whether coffee grounds can be used as a soil amendment for succulents. The answer is yes - coffee grounds can be beneficial for succulents.

Coffee grounds are acidic, which makes them a good choice for amending soil with a high pH level. They are also rich in nitrogen, potassium, and magnesium, all of which are nutrients that succulents need. Additionally, coffee grounds help to improve soil drainage and aeration.

If you're looking to add coffee grounds to your succulent's soil, it's best to do so sparingly. A little goes a long way - too much can make the soil too acidic and could potentially harm your plants.

## Is Alkaline Water Good for Succulents

There are many opinions on whether or not alkaline [water is good for succulents](https://veggiesville.com/how-to-water-succulent/). Some people say that the higher pH level in alkaline water is beneficial to succulents because it helps to prevent root rot and other diseases. Others say that the opposite is true and that alkaline water actually harms succulents by leaching nutrients from their roots. The truth is, there is no definitive answer when it comes to whether or not alkaline water is good for succulents.

## Conclusions

The best way to find out if your succulents prefer alkaline or regular water is to test it out. Start by watering your plants with regular tap water and then watering them with alkaline water a few days later. Observe how they look and feel, and take note of any differences.
