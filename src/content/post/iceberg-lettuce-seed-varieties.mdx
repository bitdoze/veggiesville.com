## Characteristics of Different Seed Varieties

### Crisphead Iceberg Lettuce

Crisphead iceberg lettuce is a popular variety known for its tight, compact heads and crisp texture. Here are the key characteristics of this seed variety:

* **Description**: Crisphead iceberg lettuce forms large, round heads with tightly packed leaves. The leaves have a crunchy texture and a mild, refreshing flavor. The outer leaves are typically light green, while the inner leaves are paler and more tightly curved.
* **Growing Conditions**: Crisphead iceberg lettuce thrives in cool climates and requires full sun or partial shade. It prefers well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter. The optimal temperature range for growth is between 45°F and 75°F (7°C and 24°C). Ensure consistent moisture during the growing season to prevent bitter-tasting leaves.
* **Harvesting**: Harvesting crisphead iceberg lettuce is typically done when the heads are firm and fully formed. To determine if the lettuce is ready for harvest, gently squeeze the heads. If they feel solid and firm, it's time to harvest. Use a sharp knife to cut the heads at the base, leaving a small stem attached. If the heads become loose or start to crack, it's a sign that they are overripe.

**Description**: Looseleaf iceberg lettuce has tender, curly leaves that range in color from light green to deep green. The leaves are slightly crinkled and have a crisp texture. This variety is appreciated for its mild flavor and versatility in salads and sandwiches.

This allows the inner leaves to continue growing. Alternatively, you can wait for the plant to mature and harvest the entire head. Harvesting should be done in the morning when the leaves are crisp and full of moisture.
