Yes, ranunculus comes back every year. They are perennial flowers, meaning they come back year after year. If you planted them in the ground last fall, they will come up again this spring. You can also replant them each year from the bulbs you purchase at the store.

If you want to add some bright pops of color to your garden this spring, then you should consider growing ranunculi. These beautiful flowers come in a variety of colors, and they are sure to catch the eye of anyone who passes by. In order to grow ranunculi, you will need plenty of sunlight and well-drained soil. You should also make sure that the area where you plant them is protected from strong winds, as these can damage the flowers. 

Ranunculi can be grown from seed or from bulbs. If you choose to grow them from seed, it will take about four weeks for them to germinate. Once the plants have reached a height of about six inches, you can begin to cut off the blooms. This will encourage the plants to continue growing and produce more blooms.

## When does Ranunculus Come Back?

This is a question that many gardeners have. In most cases, ranunculus will return in the late summer or early fall.

Once you see new growth, it is likely that the flowers will return within a few weeks.

## How Does Ranunculus Come Back?

When you plant ranunculus bulbs, they will naturalize and come back year after year. To get them to come back, however, you need to do a little work in the fall.

When the weather starts to cool in the fall, go through your garden and dig up all of the bulbs. Trim off any dead or dying parts of the bulb and replant them in soil that is well-drained. You can also divide large clumps of bulbs into smaller ones at this time. If you live in an area with cold winters, mulch over the planted bulbs to protect them from freezing temperatures.

## Do ranunculus bulbs multiply
