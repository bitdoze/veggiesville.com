Succulents are a type of plant that can grow in rocks without soil. This is possible because succulents have specially adapted leaves that allow them to store water in their tissues. Succulents can also get the water they need from the air, so they don't need to be planted in soil. This makes them a great choice for rock gardens, since they can grow in the crevices between rocks without taking up any space. Succulents also come in a variety of colors, so they can add interest to any garden.
