## Planting Iceberg Lettuce

Once you have prepared the soil and selected the right seeds, it's time to plant your iceberg lettuce. There are two common methods for planting iceberg lettuce: direct seeding and transplanting seedlings.

### Direct Seeding

Direct seeding involves planting the lettuce seeds directly into the garden bed or container where they will grow. This method is suitable for gardeners who prefer to start from scratch and have the time to devote to nurturing the seedlings from the beginning.

To direct seed iceberg lettuce:

1. Prepare the soil by removing any weeds or debris and loosening it to a depth of about 6 inches.
2. Create furrows or shallow trenches in the soil, spacing them around 12 to 18 inches apart. The furrows should be approximately 1/4 inch deep.
3. Sow the lettuce seeds along the furrows, spacing them according to the seed packet instructions. Cover the seeds lightly with soil or vermiculite.
4. Water the area gently to ensure the soil is moist but not soaked.
5. Keep the soil consistently moist during germination and as the seedlings grow. Be careful not to overwater, as excessive moisture can lead to rot or disease.

Direct seeding allows for a natural growth process and can be an economical choice as it eliminates the need for purchasing seedlings. However, it requires patience and careful monitoring of the seedlings as they emerge and develop.

### Transplanting Seedlings

Transplanting seedlings is another popular method for growing iceberg lettuce and offers the advantage of a head start in the growing process. This method is beneficial for gardeners who want to minimize the time it takes for the lettuce to mature and harvest.

To transplant iceberg lettuce seedlings:

1. Start by germinating the lettuce seeds indoors, following the instructions on the seed packet or our article on [iceberg lettuce seed varieties](https://veggiesville.com/iceberg-lettuce-seed-varieties).
2. Once the seedlings have grown to a suitable size, typically around 3 to 4 inches tall, they are ready for transplanting.
3. Prepare the planting area by ensuring the soil is loose, well-drained, and enriched with compost or organic matter.
4. Dig holes in the soil that are slightly larger than the root ball of each seedling. Space the holes according to the recommended spacing for iceberg lettuce, typically around 12 to 18 inches apart.
5. Carefully remove each seedling from its container, being cautious not to damage the delicate roots.
6. Place the seedlings into the holes and gently firm the soil around the base of each plant.
7. Water the newly transplanted seedlings thoroughly to help them establish in their new environment.

Transplanting seedlings can save time and provide a head start in the growing process. However, it requires more initial effort and care to ensure successful transplantation and establishment.
