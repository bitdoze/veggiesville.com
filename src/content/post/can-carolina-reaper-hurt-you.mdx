The Carolina Reaper pepper is known as one of the hottest peppers in the world and has gained notoriety around the globe. With its intense heat, many are left wondering if the Carolina Reaper can actually hurt them. As people become more daring with their food choices, it is important to know what risks may be associated with consuming extremely hot peppers such as this one. In this article, we will explore whether or not eating a Carolina Reaper can actually cause harm.

## Overview: What is the Carolina Reaper?

The Carolina Reaper is a notoriously spicy pepper that has been gaining popularity over the past few years. The Carolina Reaper is a record-breaking chili pepper that has become incredibly popular among both chili enthusiasts and casual eaters alike. Developed by Ed "Smokin' Ed" Currie, the Carolina Reaper was officially recognized by Guinness World Records in 2013 as the world's hottest pepper with an average peak heat rating of 1,569,300 Scoville Heat Units (SHU). The Carolina Reaper gets its intense heat from the combination of genetics from a variety of peppers including the Red Habanero and Naga Viper—it's even said to have traces of Chocolate habanero within it. 

At first glance, it may appear as if all Carolina Reapers are identical; however, there can be some variations depending on where they were [grown](https://veggiesville.com/grow-carolina-reaper-in-pots/) and when.

## Heat: Scoville Rating of Carolina Reaper

The Carolina Reaper is one of the hottest peppers in existence, and it has a heat rating to match. The pepper was developed by South Carolina farmer Ed Currie and is currently the Guinness World Record holder for being the hottest chili pepper in the world. It measures an incredible 2.2 million Scoville Heat Units (SHU) on the Scoville Scale, leaving other chilis far behind in its wake. 

The Scoville Scale is used to measure pungency or spiciness of chili peppers, and it was invented by American pharmacist Wilbur Lincoln Scoville in 1912. The scale works by evaluating how much sugar water solution needs to be mixed with a pepper sample before people can no longer detect any heat from it.

## Potential Risks: Health Concerns of Carolina Reaper

But what are the potential health risks associated with consuming such an intense pepper? Let's take a look at some of the possible consequences that may arise from ingesting this fiery treat.

First, consuming large amounts of Carolina Reaper can cause uncomfortable and even dangerous symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In addition to these physical symptoms, consuming too much can also be psychologically damaging; people who consume large concentrations of capsaicinoids —the compounds that give chilies their heat—may experience confusion, anxiety and hallucinations when consumed in high doses.

## Eating It Whole: Is it Dangerous? 

Eating one can be extremely painful and even cause serious health risks for some people if precautions are not taken. Eating it whole is one of the most dangerous ways to consume a Carolina Reaper. Eating this way can cause extreme stomach pain and even vomiting, which may lead to choking or other serious complications. There are also long term health risks to consuming chilies whole. The seeds of the Carolina Reaper can cause intestinal blockage and even diarrhea, because of their hard exterior.

The seeds themselves can be extremely sharp and cause internal bleeding when consumed in large quantities. Eating a Carolina Reaper whole is not recommended. The pepper has been known to cause extreme pain and discomfort in the digestive tract after consumption. It can also lead to other health risks and ailments, including vomiting and stomach pain.

## Cooking with It: How to Use Safely

Cooking with Carolina Reaper peppers can be an exciting experience, but it’s important to use them safely. The Carolina Reaper pepper is among the spiciest peppers in the world and incredibly potent, so taking a few precautions when handling them is essential. When selecting Carolina Reapers for cooking, look for peppers that are bright red and glossy. Avoid any peppers that appear dull or have dark spots on them as these can indicate they aren’t fresh. Always wear gloves when handling the peppers to prevent skin irritation, and make sure to wash your hands carefully after touching them. When cutting the pepper into smaller pieces, avoid touching your eyes as this will cause intense burning and irritation
